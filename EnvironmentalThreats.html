                <h2>White Nose Syndrome</h2>
                <p>White Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a disease causing the Little Brown Myotis to awaken during hibernation (Environment Canada, 2015). 
                    This fatal disease is caused by a fungus that grows on its muzzle, depleting the bat of its resources twice as fast as usual (Canadian Wildlife Federation, 2019). 
                    Not only is resource depletion a concern, but the fungus can also cause high carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream resulting in acidosis and hyperkalemia (Canadian Wildlife Federation, 2019). 
                    It is hypothesized that the fungus originated from people visiting bat caves (Environment Canada, 2015).</p>

                <h2>Current Issues</h2>
                <p>WNS is considered the biggest factor contributing to the endangerment of the species, 
                    therefore any other anthropogenic factors are further putting the species at risk. 
                    The Little Brown Myotis is the only bat species to commonly roost in buildings and other anthropogenic sites, 
                    where they remain especially loyal. Certain roost sites have been utilized for up to 50 years by the same returning bats. 
                    Current issues impeding roost habitats include forestry practices, agriculture, oil and gas development, and any kind of urban, residential, or industrial development
                    (Environment Canada, 2015).</p>

                <h2>Strategies to Reduce Impact</h2>
                <p>Reducing human impact is possible if strategies can be developed to increase population growth. 
                    Possible strategies include preservation of maternal roosts, habitat enhancement techniques used to increase optimal roosting locations, 
                    and limiting the access and disturbance to wintering habitats (Government of Canada,2018). 
                    Possible strategies for Albertans willing to help conserve the population include building 
                    bat homes for your properties that the bats will utilize as roosting habitat. </p>
