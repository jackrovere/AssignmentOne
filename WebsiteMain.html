                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The little brown myotis is a species of mouse-eared microbat found in North America. 
                    It has a small body size and glossy brown fur. It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats, 
                    including the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and Arizona myotis, to which it is closely related. Despite its name, 
                    the little brown bat is not closely related to the big brown bat, which belongs to a different genus.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    Its mating system is polygynandrous, or promiscuous, and females give birth to one offspring annually. 
                    The offspring, called pups, are quickly weaned and reach adult size in some dimensions by three weeks old. 
                    The little brown bat has a mean lifespan of 6.5 years, though one individual in the wild reached 34 years old. 
                    It is nocturnal, foraging for its insect prey at night and roosting in hollow trees or buildings during the day, 
                    among less common roost types. It navigates and locates prey with echolocation.
